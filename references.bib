abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of AI models. The high cost of hosting AI services on GPUs and their demanding service requirements, make it timely and challenging to lower service costs and guarantee service quality. While spot instances have long been offered with a large discount, spot preemptions have discouraged users from using them to host model replicas when serving AI models.To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient policy, SpotHedge, that leverages spot replicas across different failure domains (e.g., regions and clouds) to ensure availability, lower costs, and high service quality. SpotHedge intelligently spreads spot replicas across different regions and clouds to improve availability and reduce correlated preemptions, over-provisions cheap spot replicas than required as a safeguard against possible preemptions, and dynamically falls back to on-demand replicas when spot replicas become unavailable. We built SkyServe, a system leveraging SpotHedge to efficiently serve AI models over a mixture of spot and on-demand replicas across regions and clouds. We compared SkyServe with both research and production systems on real AI workloads: SkyServe reduces cost by 43\% on average while achieving high resource availability compared to using on-demand replicas. Additionally, SkyServe improves P50, P90, and P99 latency by 2.3\texttimes{}, 2.1\texttimes{}, 2.1\texttimes{} on average compared to other research and production systems.},

abstract = {Large language model (LLM) serving is becoming an increasingly critical workload for cloud providers. Existing LLM serving systems focus on interactive requests, such as chatbots and coding assistants, with tight latency SLO requirements. However, when such systems execute batch requests that have relaxed SLOs along with interactive requests, it leads to poor multiplexing and inefficient resource utilization. To address these challenges, we propose QLM, a queue management system for LLM serving. QLM maintains batch and interactive requests across different models and SLOs in a request queue. Optimal ordering of the request queue is critical to maintain SLOs while ensuring high resource utilization. To generate this optimal ordering, QLM uses a Request Waiting Time (RWT) Estimator that estimates the waiting times for requests in the request queue. These estimates are used by a global scheduler to orchestrate LLM Serving Operations (LSOs) such as request pulling, request eviction, load balancing, and model swapping. Evaluation on heterogeneous GPU devices and models with real-world LLM serving dataset shows that QLM improves SLO attainment by 40-90\% and throughput by 20-400\% while maintaining or improving device utilization compared to other state-of-the-art LLM serving systems. QLM's evaluation is based on the production requirements of a cloud provider. QLM is publicly available at https://www.github.com/QLM-project/QLM.},

abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) services such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Cursor have quickly become essential for society, businesses, and individuals, empowering applications such as chatbots, image generation, and code assistance. The complexity of LLM systems makes them prone to failures and affects their reliability and availability, yet their failure patterns are not fully understood, making it an emerging problem. However, there are limited datasets and studies in this area, particularly lacking an open-access tool for analyzing LLM service failures based on incident reports. Addressing these problems, in this work we propose FAILS, the first open-sourced framework for incident reports collection and analysis on different LLM services and providers. FAILS provides comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization capabilities, including: (1) It can automatically collect, clean, and update incident data through its data scraper and processing components;(2) It provides 17 types of failure analysis, allowing users to explore temporal trends of incidents, analyze service reliability metrics, such as Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF);(3) It leverages advanced LLM tools to assist in data analysis and interpretation, enabling users to gain observations and insights efficiently. All functions are integrated in the backend, allowing users to easily access them through a web-based frontend interface. FAILS supports researchers, engineers, and general users to understand failure patterns and further mitigate operational incidents and outages in LLM services. The framework is publicly available on https://github.com/atlarge-research/FAILS.},
