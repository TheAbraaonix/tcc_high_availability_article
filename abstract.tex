This study presents an integrative mapping of research on high availability strategies applied to artificial intelligence (AI) systems in cloud computing environments. Given the increasing adoption of AI for critical applications, ensuring service resilience and fault tolerance in distributed infrastructures has become a key concern. To understand the current state of knowledge, a structured literature mapping was conducted using IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library as primary sources, covering the period from 2015 to 2025. A total of 706 studies were identified and screened based on explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in 5 publications deemed highly relevant.

The findings reveal a fragmented research landscape, with most studies proposing isolated, case-specific solutions rather than unified frameworks. Significant gaps include the lack of approaches tailored to Generative AI workloads, mechanisms for availability in private and hybrid clouds, and AI-specific self-healing strategies. These gaps suggest the need for further investigation into robust, scalable, and adaptive availability models that align with the dynamic nature of AI systems.

This mapping lays the groundwork for future systematic reviews and practical advances, aiming to strengthen reliability and resilience in AI-driven cloud services.
