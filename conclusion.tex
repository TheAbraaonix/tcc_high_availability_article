This study mapped research on high availability strategies for AI systems in cloud environments, revealing a limited but growing body of work. Most existing studies propose case-specific approaches, with a notable absence of comprehensive or generalizable frameworks.

Key gaps identified include dedicated support for Generative AI workloads, strategies for private and hybrid clouds, and AI-specific self-healing mechanisms. These aspects are increasingly critical as AI services become central to business and infrastructure operations.

This overview highlights opportunities to advance the reliability and resilience of AI deployments in the cloud. Future research should build on this mapping through systematic reviews and empirical studies that synthesize existing solutions and inform the design of unified, adaptive availability strategies for AI workloads.
